This project is complete! Any questions or comments you have are welcome. It is done in ADA, a language that was sold to us as the future of security, but it seems that no one uses it in the industry, at least not in Mexico.

However, it works and can be used! I hope it is useful in some way. If you use it, don't forget to give me credit. It's not mandatory, but it would be nice.
